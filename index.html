		<h2>BROKEN DESIGN</h2>
		<p> I discovered a prime example of developers possesing little insight into how users might interact with an application (or the world for that matter) with the upcoming dating application Legal Fling. The app propses to provide a digital means through which parties can request and grant sexual consent on their devices bonding the two in a "legal contract" regarding their sexual encounter.</p>

		<p>While it may seem admirable to make the requesting and granting of sexual consent explicit this design oversimplifies an extremely complex human interaction with highly problematic implications. Descriptions of the app state that consent can be "withdrawn at any time"-though if one must access their phone in order to withdraw consent this offers poor stand in for good communication between people. This design is clearly biased towards those who fear accusations of sexual misconduct while offering little protection towards potential victims. This interface could even be used as a tool for pressure and coersion where the digital granting of consent supercedes the lived reality of the sexual encounter. This is broken design because it acheives the opposite of what it proposes, by trying to make consent a transparent exchange it further distorts the human interaction and alienates people from their agency (plus it is really unsexy).</p>
